OtherInfo-                Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the sell’s duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target reeats the saving throw. It takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the sell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can’t be extinguished by nonmagical means.
