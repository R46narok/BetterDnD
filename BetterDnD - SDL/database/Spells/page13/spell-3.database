OtherInfo-                You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the sell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this sell if you cast it again. While affected by this sell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination sells can't locate or erceive the target.
