OtherInfo-                When you cast this sell, you inscribe a glyh that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyh. The glyh can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this sell, the glyh is broken, and the sell ends without being triggered.
