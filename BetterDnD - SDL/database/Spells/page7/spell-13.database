OtherInfo-                This sell shaes a creature's dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this sell. The target must be on the same lane of existence as you. Creatures that don't slee, such as elves, can't be contacted by this sell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can't take actions or move.
