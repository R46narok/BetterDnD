OtherInfo-                A beam of yellow light flashes from your ointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen oint within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the sell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an exlosion of flame that sreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius shere centered on that oint must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
