OtherInfo-                You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a lace you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in lace for the duration, and it can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.
