OtherInfo-                The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature's ower. For the duration, you can use your sellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weaon, and the weaon's damage die becomes a d8. The weaon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The sell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weaon.
