OtherInfo-                You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 sychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
