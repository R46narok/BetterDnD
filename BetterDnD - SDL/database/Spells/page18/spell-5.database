OtherInfo-                You create an illusory coy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The coy can aear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disaears, and the sell ends.
