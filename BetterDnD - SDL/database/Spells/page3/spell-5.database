OtherInfo-                Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the sell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current lane of existence and aear in the Ethereal Plane (the sell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that lane). At the start of your next turn, and when the sell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccuied sace of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the sace you vanished from. If no unoccuied sace is available within that range, you aear in the nearest unoccuied sace (chosen at random if more than one sace is equally near). You can dismiss this sell as an action.
