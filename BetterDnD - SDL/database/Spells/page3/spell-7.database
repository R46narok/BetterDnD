OtherInfo-                You cause u to six illars of stone to burst from laces on the ground that you can see within range. Each illar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of u to 30 feet. The ground where a illar aears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each illar has AC 5 and 30 hit oints. When reduced to 0 hit oints, a illar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter ortion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
