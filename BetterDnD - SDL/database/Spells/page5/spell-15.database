OtherInfo-                You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the sell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire’s sace when you cast the sell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the bonfire’s sace for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
