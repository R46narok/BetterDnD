OtherInfo-                You mentally contact a demigod, the sirit of a long- dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another lane. Contacting this extralanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this sell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 sychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and seak only in gibberish.
