OtherInfo-                A 10-foot-radius invisible shere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the shere, sells can't be cast, summoned creatures disaear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the sell ends, the shere moves with you, centered on you.
