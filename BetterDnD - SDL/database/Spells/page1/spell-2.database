OtherInfo-                The sell catures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage tye until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering tye, and the sell ends.
