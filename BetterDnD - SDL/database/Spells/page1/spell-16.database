OtherInfo-                This sell attracts or reels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then secify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vamires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or reels the secified creatures for the duration. Choose antiathy or symathy as the aura's effect.
