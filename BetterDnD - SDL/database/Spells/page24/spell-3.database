OtherInfo-                This sell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the sell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.
