OtherInfo-                This sell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface--such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava--as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). U to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.
