OtherInfo-                You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average examle of that creature, one without any class levels or the Sellcasting trait.
