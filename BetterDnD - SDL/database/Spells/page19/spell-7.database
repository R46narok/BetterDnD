OtherInfo-                You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the sell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful sell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or sell. This sell doesn't rotect the warded creature from area effects, such as the exlosion of a fireball.
