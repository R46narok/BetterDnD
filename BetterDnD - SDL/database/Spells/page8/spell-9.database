OtherInfo-                Choose a oint you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone eruts in a 20-foot cube centered on that oint. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square ortion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
