OtherInfo-                This sell allows you to find the shortest, most direct hysical route to a secific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same lane of existence. If you name a destination on another lane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn't secific (such as "a green dragon's lair"), the sell fails.
