OtherInfo-                You establish a teleathic link with one beast you touch that is friendly to you or charmed by you. The sell fails if the beastâ€™s Intelligence is 4 or higher. Until the sell ends, the link is active while you and the beast are within line of sight of each other. Through the link, the beast can understand your teleathic messages to it, and it can teleathically communicate simle emotions and concets back to you. While the link is active, the beast gains advantage on attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that you can see.
