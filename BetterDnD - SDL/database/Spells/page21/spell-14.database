OtherInfo-                When you cast this sell, you inscribe a harmful glyh either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyh (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyh can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its lace; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this sell, the glyh is broken, and the sell ends without being triggered.
