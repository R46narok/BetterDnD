OtherInfo-                You gain the ability to move or maniulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the sell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the aroriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the rior target is no longer affected by the sell.
