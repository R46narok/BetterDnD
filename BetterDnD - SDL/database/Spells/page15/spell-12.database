OtherInfo-                You create six tiny meteors in your sace. They float in the air and orbit you for the sell’s duration. When you cast the sell — and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter — you can exend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a oint or oints you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or imacts against a solid surface, the meteor exlodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the oint where the meteor exlodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
