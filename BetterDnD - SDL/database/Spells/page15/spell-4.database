OtherInfo-                You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible henomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image aears at a sot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems comletely real, including sounds, smells, and temerature aroriate to the thing deicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).
