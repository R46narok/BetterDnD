OtherInfo-                You touch one to three ebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged sell attack with one of the ebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the ebble, that attacker adds your sellcasting ability modifier, not the attackerâ€™s, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your sellcasting ability modifier. Hit or miss, the sell then ends on the stone.
